## üåü Overview

**DNAT (From Nothing to Everything)** is a project with organized and accessible
documentation, built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/), a modern
and efficient static site generator. The main objective of this project is to
provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use documentation platform, allowing users
to access detailed information about crypto, blockchain, security, and much
more.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

Below is the organized project structure:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .vitepress/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.ts          # Main VitePress configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ locales/           # Language-specific configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                # Static files (images, icons, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md           # Project homepage (Default PT-BR)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ locale/            # Folders for each supported language
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/          # This is where you should add your pages
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md       # Homepage for the language
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Project general overview
```

> üí° **Tip:** Use this structure as a reference when adding new pages or
> modifying the project, always aiming to maintain a consistent pattern.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### 1. Adding Pages

To add new pages to the documentation, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `src/` folder, where there's a folder for each supported
   language.
2. Choose the desired language and enter `docs`, which is the folder where
   content should be added:
   - Create a new folder with the desired page name.
   - Or create a `.md` file inside an existing folder, always respecting the
     folder hierarchy.
3. Add content in **Markdown** format.
4. Update the `.vitepress/locales/<locale>.ts` file to include the new page path
   in the sidebar.

### 2. Translations

To translate content to new languages:

1. Edit files in `.vitepress/locales/`.
2. Keep keys synchronized between languages to ensure consistency.
3. Update the `config.ts` file to include the new language if necessary.

### **3. Committing and Sending Changes**

To ensure that all changes are consistent and easy to understand, we are using
the **Conventional Commits** standard. If you are not familiar with the subject,
check the
[official documentation](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

#### **Step by Step to Make a Commit**

1. **Update Your Branch**  
   Make sure your branch is synchronized with `main`. Execute:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Add Changes**  
   Add all modified files to the staging area:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Start the Commit**  
   Run the command below to start the commit assistant:

   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

4. **Automatic Analysis with Lint-Staged**

   - **lint-staged** will automatically analyze all modified files.
   - During this step, it will adjust code formatting and remove metadata from
     images and other files.

5. **Create the Commit with Conventional Commits**  
   After lint-staged analysis, the commit assistant will open. Follow the
   instructions to create a commit following the **Conventional Commits**
   standard.

### üí° **Important Tips**

- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive messages to facilitate
  understanding of changes and preferably in English.  
  Example:
  ```
  feat: add metadata removal support
  fix: correct image formatting error
  docs: update contribution guide
  ```
- **Test Locally**: Before sending your changes, run local tests to ensure
  everything works as expected.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the site locally at:  
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### Build

## üìã Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to keep documentation organized and consistent:

- **Organization by themes:** Create thematic folders inside `src/locale/docs/`
  to group related pages.
- **Updated translations:** Whenever adding or modifying content, ensure all
  translations are synchronized.
- **Established standards:** Follow the style and conventions already defined in
  the project to ensure uniformity.

### üîç Markdown Usage Example

#### Nested Lists

Use nested lists to organize hierarchical information:

```markdown
- Main Category
  - Subcategory 1
    - Item 1
    - Item 2
  - Subcategory 2
```

#### Tables

Tables are useful for organizing tabular information:

| Command         | Description                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies         |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts development server     |
| `npm run build` | Builds project for production |

#### Code Blocks

Use code blocks to highlight commands or examples:

```javascript
const message = 'Hello, world!';
console.log(message);
```
